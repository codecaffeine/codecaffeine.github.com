Last Thursday I did a presentation on *UIViewController Containers* for [PhillyCocoa](http://phillycocoa.org). My presentation slides can be [found on Speaker Deck](http://speakerdeck.com/u/mthomas/p/uiviewcontroller-containers).

The example **Card Stack Controller** project I wrote can be [found on github](https://github.com/codecaffeine/CardStackController). Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions, corrections, or other thoughts.

**update:** If you're having trouble running it on Xcode 4.2, please get the latest from the repository. I fixed a bug that caused a crash when built with Xcode 4.2
